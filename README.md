## React Native HP tracker for the game MTG

First test app created with React Native. Due to a previous project 'GTVR' I needed to learn how to use an ISO development tool. 
Due to my previous knowledge with React, React Native seemed to be the go to answer for my problem. Rather than creating a generic
testing application I decided to create something I could actually use while learning how to use React Native. This app was inspired
from the game MTG arena where I am attempting to emulate the game flow offline. 

*This app is solely for learning purposes and will only be used locally*
